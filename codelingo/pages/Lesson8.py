st.write("""
The `try` and `except` block in Python is used to catch and handle errors during program execution.

- Code inside the `try` block is attempted first.
- If an error occurs (like trying to convert a non-number to `int()`), Python stops executing the `try` block and jumps to the `except` block.
- This prevents the program from crashing and allows you to respond to the error gracefully.

In the example above, if the user enters something that can't be converted to a number (like "abc"), the program catches the `ValueError` and prints a friendly message.

st.code(code_finally, language='python')

st.write("""
The `finally` block is used to define code that should run **no matter what happens** in the `try` and `except` blocks.

- If no error occurs, the `finally` block still runs.
- If an error **does** occur, and it's caught by an `except`, the `finally` block runs **after** the exception handling.
- It's commonly used for **cleanup tasks**, such as closing files or releasing resources.

In this example, whether or not the file is found, the message `"Cleaning up..."` will always be printed.

st.code(code_multi_exceptions, language='python')

st.write("""
Sometimes, a block of code might raise **more than one type of exception**. Instead of writing separate `except` blocks for each, you can group them using a tuple.

- `(TypeError, ValueError)` means this block will catch **either** type of error.
- Using `as e` gives access to the actual error object, so you can print or log it.

In this example, if `risky_code()` raises a `TypeError` or `ValueError`, the error will be caught and displayed without crashing the program.

st.code(code_custom_exception, language='python')

st.write("""
Python lets you define your **own exception types** by creating a class that inherits from `Exception`.

- Custom exceptions are useful when you want to handle specific errors in your own way.
- They make your code cleaner, especially in larger projects.

In this example, `MyError` is a custom exception. The `risky()` function raises it, and itâ€™s caught by the `except` block to display a custom message.
